      Each record in this table represents the daily performance of ads.

      LinkedIn Ads has a slightly different hierarchy than the other marketing platforms. As identified within [Microsoft's Campaign Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads/account-structure/create-and-manage-campaign-groups?tabs=http)
      documentation, the hierarchy consists of multiple campaigns for a single campaign group. As this hierarchy is the inverse of the standard hierarchy seen within the
      other platforms, the `campaign` and `campaign_group` are switched for LinkedIn Ads within the ad_reporting table for consistency across platforms.
